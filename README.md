# A Forecast a Day keeps the Doctor away - Predicting US Influenza Rates

This repository contains the code for the TechLabs ST19 Project Curaio.

This project aims at predicting Influenza like illness rates (ILI) for the US using historical time series data as well as Google Trends data for typical Influenza and flu symptoms. 

A post describing this project can also be found on my [Blog](https://tlary.github.io/post/curaio_clean/).
